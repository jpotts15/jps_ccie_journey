# Cisco DNA Center VM Homelab Install
DNA Center is a key obstacle in the CCIE now as its on the blueprint but a much steeper lift then previous labs. Imagine studying 10 years ago and the biggest hardship is getting GNS3 to work right, must have been nice

# DNA Center on VMware
Trying on 2.3.7.4 as that is the current release and only OVF available on a HP DL 380 gen 9
Cisco released a ovf install of DNA Center. I've tried at least 5 times but everytime it fails to install. My server is just below specs (not enough committed mhz but is over spec w/ turbo boost so idk) 

The dnac esxi ovf is new and I can't actually find anyone who documented successfully installing it. I'm sure there is probably a way as someone probably tested it in cisco after bundling it but who knows what platforms/conditions that was and the process to do it. I've read the install guide but who knows, sure i'm missing something but for now its not worth the time to continue on   

Trying again with the iso of 2.3.5.5
