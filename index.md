I've somewhat recently started studying for the CCIE Enterprise Lab exam and man are there some really dumb things that it seems everyone just sort of deals with or hand jams to overcome which leads me to writing one off scripts or creating labs as gap fillers that I thought others could potentially use which is why i've created this page.
