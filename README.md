The real intent here is to document resources, my setup and other things for reference for others. So many little things that can become time sinks that would be better spent elsewhere. I prefer to read and see docs and will try to keep most things in that formnat unless a video makes sense. I mainly am put off by the modern everything has to be "content", if you want that go to youtube and search ccie journey and there are tons of things on there but unfortunately many don't have any actual value. 

## Money and Time
If you dig into what the CCIE looks like today and the stories of many people who have gotten it over the last several years you might find like I did that many stress how much time and money they spent to get the CCIE. Spend 6k on this boot camp, 1k on a subscription to this, 1k on books, another 4k on another boot camp, another 2k on lab equipment and on and on. My default position is to spend money where needed but its marginal value (in a economics sort of sense) has to be there. My default position is to not spend money unless it makes sense whereas many seem to justify it with the "this is an investment" mindset. I'm not trying to belittle others but I just found it weird the lengths some people go to the point I see the CCIE as a bit of a industry that has been monetized in multiple ways that I just don't like.

Just like with money, time is something many people go into great lengths into talking about how much they spent to the point I feel many take it overboard or are just not being really truthful with things because they feel it soudns good to say they've read every RFC cover to cover and spenbt 2000 hours reading the docs on the IOS 12.4(4)T command reference guide espeically how the finger command is implemented. Just like I don't want to spend a bunch of money, I also don't want to waste a bunch of time. If its important and useful I'll pour some time in it, if its obsolete or I otherwise feel is not very useful but part of the blueprint then I'll learn it and move on. If it doesn't fit into those then I'll probably just skip it unless I particularly like it. An example of this is the lab infrastructure, I just want it to work, I document what I do because I feel I'll need to know it later or that it might help others but other people take it a step beyond that and document and build out things that put some production enviroments to shame.

## Scripts
Part of this will also be trying to script stuff to make it easier to study. I've gotten alright with python so always look to find ways to use that. These scripts are as is so if they don't work then modify them or just move on. 

### CCIE Lab Helper
I started writing juypter notebooks to follow along with the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Foundations book but still go back and forth if thats the best format for that. 

I hate building one offs but I also don't want to spend tons of time building tools that will still be somewhat obsolete in 4 or so years since the book itself will eventually be obsolete 

## Will I actually get the CCIE 
This isn't my first time starting to study for CCIE, I "started" after CCNP (12ish years ago) but quickly fell off. Then started again but made the decision to learn python and automation instead. So why this time? Well I started a job where I have much more free time to study and honestly it gives me a good anchor point to spend free time at work.  

## Is the CCIE worth it
Probably not in all honesty, its a lot of time and money to spend. I'm established in my career, have tons of experience, a good resume and other stuff where the CCIE will probably help but its not make or break in many cases. Its still a goal of mine though that I've always held in the back of my mind and circumstances are right. Sure many discussions online will say its fallen from grace and otherwise not what it once was but really what else is there if you want that next acheivement. 

## Lab Topology 
My lab, I've been getting by on the workstation for years and just bought the server specifically for DNAC

## Quick Notes
DNA Center is a real pain, plan to install DNAC when you have other things to do, press the button and walk away
