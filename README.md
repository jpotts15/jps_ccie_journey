# Poor Lazy CCIE Journey
Maybe I should I have put more thought into the title because on second look its a bit negative but oh well. 

The real intent here is to document resources, my setup and other things for reference for others. 

Poor is more meant to be cheap or thrifty. After reading many people's journeys they spend 4k for this boot camp, and 6k for this one, and spend 2k on a server and on and on. I'm just trying to get a cert that already costs almost 2k in of itself, I don't want to go spending another 20k just to get there. 

Lazy is also mean to be more tongue and check in that just like many will tell you how much they spent money wise folks will also go into huge detail on how they spent 2000 hours reading the docs on the IOS 12.4(4)T command reference guide espeically how the finger command is implemented. Just like I don't want to spend a bunch of money, I also don't want to waste a bunch of time. If its important and useful I'll pour some time in it, if its obsolete or I otherwise feel is not very useful but part of the blueprint then I'll learn it and move on. If it doesn't fit into those then I'll probably just skip it. 

## Scripts
Part of this will also be trying to script stuff to make it easier to study. I've gotten alright with python so always look to find ways to use that. These scripts are as is so if they don't work then modify them or just move on. 

### CCIE Lab Helper
I started writing juypter notebooks to follow along with the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Foundations book but still go back and forth if thats the best format for that. 

I hate building one offs but I also don't want to spend tons of time building tools that will still be somewhat obsolete in 4 or so years since the book itself will eventually be obsolete 

## Will I actually get the CCIE 
This isn't my first time starting to study for CCIE, I "started" after CCNP (12ish years ago) but quickly fell off. Then started again but made the decision to learn python and automation instead. So why this time? Well I started a job where I have much more free time to study and honestly it gives me a good anchor point to spend free time at work.  

## Is the CCIE worth it
Probably not in all honesty, its a lot of time and money to spend. I'm established in my career, have tons of experience, a good resume and other stuff where the CCIE will probably help but its not make or break in many cases. Its still a goal of mine though that I've always held in the back of my mind and circumstances are right. Sure many discussions online will say its fallen from grace and otherwise not what it once was but really what else is there if you want that next acheivement. 

## Lab Topology 
My lab, I've been getting by on the workstation for years and just bought the server specifically for DNAC
